Summary: From 2008 to 2012, I worked on my thesis which dealt with power line communication in vehicles. I studied the feasability of high data rates for in-vehicle PLC communications. 
Status: published


### Topic
The automotive industry use more and more electronic devices to replace the mechanic systems and to provide security and multimedia services.
All these electronic devices need to communicate between them.
That's why, there is a growth of the communication networks in vehicles.
The automotive communication networks like CAN or FlexRay (10 Mbps) are widely used in vehicles.
However, it is necessary to reduce the number of wires (e.g. a vehicle can have 3 km of wires for a weight of 50 kg) and to increase the throughput.
The feasibility of new networks based on power line communication (PLC) and radio frequency (RF) transmissions has been studied.
This types of techniques do not induce additional wires installation.

### Research Interests

- Power Line Communication and wireless communication.
- Channel measurements and characterization: transfert function and noise analysis.                            
- Software defined radio: the GNUradio project and the USRP2 card.

### Project
The CIFAER research project concerns the definition of an embedded architecture, innovative both in terms of electronic control unit (ECU) and communication interfaces supported (RF & PLC).
New services for the software layers of the system that supports such an infrastructure are proposed.
The design of such system is facilited by the addition of new methods incorporating the reconfigurable nature of the proposed architecture.
The project objectives are part of the topic "Innnovative Architectures and Methodology for the design of on-chip architectures" of the call for projects "Architecture of the future".
